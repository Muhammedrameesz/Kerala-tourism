          Since its incorporation as a state, Kerala's economy largely operated under welfare-based democratic 
          socialist principles. This mode of development, though it resulted in a high Human Development Index
           and standard of living among the people, led to an economic stagnation in the 1980s (growth rate
            are 2.3% annually). This apparent paradox—high human development and low economic 
            development—led to a large number of educated unemployed seeking jobs overseas, especially in 
            the Gulf countries. Due to a large number of expatriates, many travel operators and agencies set 
            up shop in the state to facilitate their travel needs. However, the trends soon reciprocated, with
             the travel agencies noticing the unrealised potential of the state as a tourist destination. The 
             first travel agency in Kerala, Kerala Travels, was founded by Col G.V. Raja of the Travancore 
             royal family along with P.G.C. Pillai.

By 1986, tourism had gained an industry status. Kerala Tourism subsequently adopted the tagline God's Own 
Country in its advertisement campaigns. Aggressive promotion in print and electronic media was able to invite 
a sizable investment in the hospitality industry. By the early 2000s, tourism had grown into a full-fledged,
 multi-billion-dollar industry in the state. The state was able to carve a niche for itself in the world 
 tourism industry, thus becoming one of the places with the "highest brand recall". In 2003, Kerala, 
 became one of the fastest-growing tourism destination in the world.

In 2012, National Geographic's Traveller magazine named Kerala as one of the "ten paradises of the world" 
and "50 must see destinations of a lifetime". Travel and Leisure also described Kerala as "One of the 100 
great trips for the 21st century". In 2012, Kerala overtook the Taj Mahal to be the number one travel 
destination in Google's search trends for India. CNN Travel listed Kerala amongst its '19 best places to
 visit in 2019. Time magazine picked Kerala among 50 ‘extraordinary destinations’ across the globe to explore 
 in 2022. The state was ranked ninth in the ‘World's Greatest Places' and was described as an ‘eco-tourism ho
 t spot'. In 2023, The New York Times selected Kerala asone of the 52 must-see tourism destinations in the world.
 Kerala was selected as thirteenth in the list and was the only state in the list from India.

  Kerala's culture is mainly Hindu in origin, deriving from a greater Tamil-heritage region known as Tamilakam. Later, Kerala's culture was elaborated on through centuries of contact with overseas cultures.[27] Native performing arts include koodiyattom, kathakali—from katha ("story") and kali ("play")—and its offshoot Kerala Natanam, koothu (akin to stand-up comedy), mohiniaattam ("dance of the enchantress"), thullal, padayani, thirayattam, and theyyam. Other arts are more religion- and tribal-themed. These include chavittu nadakom, oppana (originally from Malabar), which combines dance, rhythmic hand clapping, and ishal vocalisations. However, many of these art forms largely play to tourists or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among most ordinary Keralites, who look to more contemporary art.

Several ancient ritualised arts are Keralite in origin; these include kalaripayattu (kalari ("place", "threshing floor", or "battlefield") and payattu ("exercise" or "practice")). Among the world's oldest martial arts, oral tradition attributes kalaripayattu's emergence to Parasurama. Other ritual arts include Thirayattam, theyyam, poorakkali and Kuthiyottam. Thirayattam is a ritual performing folk art form of South Malabar region. Processions often include traditional music such as Panchari melam or Panchavadyam.

In respect of Fine Arts, the state has an abounding tradition of both ancient and contemporary art and artists. The traditional Kerala murals are found in ancient temples, churches and palaces across the State. These paintings, mostly dating to between the 9th to 12th centuries AD, display a distinct style, and a colour code which is predominantly ochre and green.

Kerala is known for its religious diversity. The major religions are Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. Jainism, Judaism, Sikhism and Buddhism have smaller followings. The state's historic ties with the rest of the world have resulted in the state having many notable temples, churches and mosques. Kerala is home to the Kottakkavu church, one of the first churches in India founded by Thomas the Apostle when he reached Indian shores, Cheraman Mosque, the first mosque in India, which is considered to have existed even before the death of the prophet Muhammad and Paradesi Synagogue, which is the oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations.

Recognising the potential of tourism in the diversity of religious faiths, related festivals and structures, the tourism department launched a "Pilgrimage tourism" project.[28][29] Major pilgrim tourism attractions include Guruvayur, Sabarimala, Malayatoor, Paradesi Synagogue, Arthunkal, Thumpoly church, St. Mary's Forane (Martha Mariam) church, Kuravilangad built in 105 A.D, Attukal Pongala (which has the Guinness record for being the largest gathering of women in the world), and Chettikulangara Bharani.

    <div class="text">
  <b><i><ins>Kerala</ins>, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern India, is one of the most 
    popular tourist destinations in the country. Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National 
    Geographic Traveler,[1] Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful 
    backwaters.[2] Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, have made 
    Kerala one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Several international agencies 
    ranging from UNESCO to National Geographic have recognised the state's tourism potential. Kerala was 
    named by TIME magazine in 2022 among the 50 extraordinary destinations to explore in its list of the 
    World's Greatest Places.[4] In 2023, Kerala was listed at the 13th spot in The New York Times' annual 
    list of places to visit and was the only tourist destination listed from India.

    Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination, with most tourism circuits 
    concentrated around the north of the country. Aggressive marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala 
    Tourism Development Corporation—the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the state—laid
     the foundation for the growth of the tourism industry. In the decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was
      able to transform itself into one of the niche holiday destinations in India. The tag line Kerala
       God's Own Country was adopted in its tourism promotions and became a global superbrand. Kerala is 
       regarded as one of the destinations with the highest brand recall.[6] In 2010, Kerala attracted 
       660,000 foreign tourist arrivals.
       <p>
        Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as well as foreign tourists. Kerala is well known 
        for its beaches, backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam, mountain ranges and wildlife sanctuaries. Other
         popular attractions in the state include the beaches at Kovalam, Muzhappilangad, Bekal and Kappad; 
         backwater tourism and lake resorts around Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam; hill stations and resorts at 
         Munnar, Wayanad, Nelliampathi, Vagamon and Ponmudi; and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries at 
         Wayanad, Periyar, Parambikulam, Silent Valley National Park and Eravikulam National Park. The
          "backwaters" region—an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that centre
           on Vembanad Lake, also see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage sites, such as the Padmanabhapuram 
           Palace, Hill Palace, and Mattancherry Palace, are also visited. To further promote tourism in
            Kerala, the Grand Kerala Shopping Festival was started by the Government of Kerala in 2007.
            Since then it has been held every year during the December–January period.
The state's tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism, which focuses on the local culture,
wilderness adventures, volunteering and personal growth of the local population. Efforts are taken to 
minimize the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment and enhance the cultural 
integrity of local people. The state has also made deep inroads into MICE Tourism mainly centered at 
Kochi.
